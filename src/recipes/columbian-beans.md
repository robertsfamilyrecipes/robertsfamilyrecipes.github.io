Adapted from [Columbian Bean by Erica Dinho](https://www.mycolombianrecipes.com/paisa-pinto-beans-frijoles-paisas/).  The original recipe is a long cook and uses plantain and pork hock - which are not easy to get hold of.  This is an anglicised version of the recipe.

### Ingredients

* 250g pack bacon, diced
* &frac12; onion, finley chopped
* bunch spring onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* &frac14; tsp ground cumin
* sunflower oil
* 2 400g tin borlotti beans, drained
* 1 carrot, cut into battons
* &frac12; potato, diced small
* &frac12; banana, mashed
* &frac12; tin tomatoes
* chicken stock pot
* 250ml water
* salt and pepper

### Method

Cook the bacon.  Heat a pan to medium and fry the bacon so the fat renders and it browns a bit.

Turn the heat to low, and fry the onions till translucent.  Add the garlic, spring onions and cumin and cook for 2 min.

Add the beans, carrot, potato, banana, tomatoes, water and stock cube.  Bring to the boil, then simmer for 30 min.  The potatoes should thicken the 'soup'.

Taste for salt.
