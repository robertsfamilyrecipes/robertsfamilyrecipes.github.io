This was the gateway salad for me...I realised you could make a salad a meal, and put in it whatever you want.  I no longer remember where I learnt it from.

### Ingredients

* 2 cos lettuce, torn into bits
* 300g box tomatoes, diced and salted
* pack of ham, diced
* gruyere cheese, diced
* _Dressing_
* 6 tbsp sunflower oil
* 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* salt and pepper
* _Croutons_
* 4 slices of thick bread, cut into cubes

### Method

Make the croutons.  Drizzle the bread with olive oil and salt, and cook in the oven on 160&deg;C for 10 min.  Taste, I aim for the crouton to be crunchy on the outside but still have a bit of give on the inside, they might need another 5 min.

Make the dressing.  Whisk together the oil, vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper.  If the dressing is a bit thick, thin with 1 tbsp of water.

Assemble the salad.  Mix the dressing into the lettuce, then add the tomatoes, ham and cheese and mix round.

Serve onto plates, with the croutons on top.
