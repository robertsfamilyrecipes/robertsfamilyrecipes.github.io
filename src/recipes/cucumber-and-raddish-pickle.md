I normally make this as a side with [Chicken Katsu Curry](./chicken-katsu-curry.html)

### Ingredients

* 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* &frac12; tsp caster sugar
* 6 radishes, topped tailed and thinly sliced
* &frac12; cucumber, thinly sliced rectangular

### Method

Whisk the oil, vinegar and sugar until the sugar is dissolved.

Add the radish and cucumber, and mix.

Leave to pickle for 15-30 min while you make the rest of the meal.
