This is an attempt to recreate the chicken and bacon club sandwich from Costa Coffee circa 2010.  The recipe is really too much to make in one go, you kinda need to have the [pasta sauce](./bacon-and-tomato-pasta.html) left over from a previous day.  

### Ingredients

* _Red Onions_
* 2 red onion sliced
* salt
* 2 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp red vinegar
* _Pasta Sauce_
* see [Bacon and Tomato Pasta](./bacon-and-tomato-pasta.html)
* _Chicken and Bacon_
* 2 chicken breast, cut thin
* &frac12; lemon
* 250g bacon
* salt and pepper
* mayonnaise
* _Sandwich_
* 100g gruyère cheese, grated
* 12 bread slices, lightly toasted

### Method

Make the onions.  Add onions, salt, sugar and vinegar to a small pan, and caramelize on medium to low heat.  This takes 30+ min.

Pasta sauce.  If the pasta sauce is already made, then warm in a small pan.  You want to drive out most of the liquid, so it is drier than a normal pasta sauce.  If it's not already made then [follow the recipe here](./bacon-and-tomato-pasta.html).

Make the chicken.  Flatten the chicken.  Heat a frying pan to hot, add oil and chicken, salt and pepper.  Turn down heat to medium and cook for 5 min.  Squeze over the lemon juice.  Flip the chick and cook for another 5 min.  Set aside and allow to cool.  

Make the bacon.  Fry bacon on medium heat, and allow fat to render.  

Chop up chicken and bacon and mix with mayo.

Assemble the sandwich.  Toast / pasta sauce and gruyère cheese / toast / chicken, bacon, mayo and red onions / toast.

Serve with chips.
