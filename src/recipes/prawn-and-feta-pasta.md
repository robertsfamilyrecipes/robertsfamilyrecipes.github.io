This recipe is from [Feasts by Sabrina Ghayour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Feasts-Sunday-bestselling-Persiana-Sirocco-ebook/dp/B0716J1Y2X/).

If you are scaling the recipe follow the proportions on the feta cheese carefully, where as the scaling on the prawns a bit high or low will be fine.

### Ingredients

&nbsp;
:   olive oil

6 cloves
:   garlic, thinly sliced

300g
:   big prawns (cooked)

1
:   lemon, zested

25g
:   butter

1tbsp
:   pul biber (allepo) chilli flakes

200g
:   feta cheese, diced

handful
:   greek basil leaves, shredded

500g
:   linguine

### Method

Set a frying pan on a medium heat, when warm add olive oil and sliced garlic.  Lets the garlic cook gently for 2 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the garlic to infuse.

Cook the pasta following the packet directions.  I use 1 tbsp of salt for 1.5 litre of water.

With about 5 minutes to go on the pasta, put the garlic back on a low heat and add the prawns, chilli and lemon zest and allow the prawn to warm through.

Drain the pasta and return to the pan.  Add the butter, and mix.  Add the prawn mixture and mix.  Add the feta cheese and basil and mix.  Add pepper.

Taste for salt.  I find the feta cheese is pretty salty here, and generally do not add more salt.

Serve, with a drizzle more of olive oil if you feel it needs it.
