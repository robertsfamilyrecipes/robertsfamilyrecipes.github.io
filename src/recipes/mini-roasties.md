This is a slightly quicker version of roast potatoes, made with new potatoes and without the need to par boil.

### Ingredients

1kg
:   new potatoes

&nbsp;
:   olive oil

&nbsp;
:   salt

### Method

Preheat the oven to 200&deg;C fan.

Cut the potatoes in half, and place on roasting tray.  Drizzle with olive oil, scatter with salt, and mix around a bit.

Cook in the oven for **45 min**.

Flip the potatoes around after about 20 min, and again near the end.  When you flip them, if they don't seem to be browning well turn the temperature up to 210&deg;C fan.
