You **need a timer**.  The broccoli cooks for 3 minutes.  If you cook for an extra 30 seconds, it goes mushy and tastes disgusting.

### Ingredients

* 1 broccoli
* 1.5 litre water
* 1 tbsp table salt

### Method

Bring a large pan of heavily salted water to the boil.

Cut the florets off the broccoli.

Add broccoli to the pan, start the timer, and cook for **3 minutes**.  Cover the pan for the first minute to quickly re-establish the boil, but then remove the lid.

Drain in a colander.
