From [Japan Centre](https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipe/301-japanese-chicken-katsu-curry).Serve with rice and [cucumber and radish pickle](./cucumber-and-raddish-pickle.html).

### Ingredients

1
:   onion, chopped

1
:   potato, peeled and chopped

1
:   carrot, peeled and chopped

500ml
:   water

6
:   katsu curry cubes

4
:   chicken breasts

&nbsp;
:   salt and pepper

&nbsp;
:   flour

2
:   eggs, beaten

&nbsp;
:   panko breadcrumbs

&nbsp;
:   vegetable oil

### Method

Get the rice going, and [make the pickle first](./cucumber-and-raddish-pickle.html).

Make the sauce.  Add potato, carrot and onion to a pan with the water.  Bring to boil and simmer for 20 min.

Prepare the chicken.  Flatten the chicken, salt and pepper, then flour, then egg, then bread crumbs.

Liquidate the sauce.  When the veg is soft, use a stick blender to liquidate.  Then add the curry cubed and mix.  Keep cooking gently till everything else is ready.  Thin with hot water to the required consistency.

Cook the chicken.  Heat the pan to hot.  Add oil and chicken, turn the heat to medium and cook for 5 min.  Flip and cook for another 5 min.  You will probably have to cook the chicken in batches, so keep warm in the mean time, and wipe the pan clean after each cook.
