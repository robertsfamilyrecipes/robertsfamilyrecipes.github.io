I've had a lot of difficulty with mac and cheese recipes, but this one [from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/mhnd1c/stove_top_mac_cheese/) is quite good.

### Ingredients

* 50g butter
* 50g flour
* 750ml milk, full fat
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp hot sauce
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* salt and pepper
* 500g macaroni
* 250g cheddar cheese, grated
* 50g parmesan cheese, grated

### Method

Make the white sauce.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the flour and cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently.  Whisk in the milk and bring to simmer, to thicken.  Melt in the cheddar cheese.

Cook the macaroni, to the packet timings minus 2 minutes.  I use 1.5 litre water and 1 tbsp salt.  Drain the pasta.

Flavour the sauce.  Add paprika, garlic powder, hot sauce, mustard, pepper.  Taste for  salt. 

Put it together.  Mix the pasta into to the sauce.  Tip into an oven-proof dish, and top with parmesan.

Cook in the oven on 200&deg;C for 10 min for the cheese to colour.
