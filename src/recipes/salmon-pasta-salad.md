### Ingredients

300g
:    tomatoes, chopped and salted

4-6
:    salmon steaks

1 bag (~150g)
:    rocket

500g
:    pasta

_For the dressing_

4 tbsp 
:    olive oil

1 tbsp
:    white wine vinegar

&frac14; tsp
:    dijon mustard

### Method

Heat the pan till decently hot.  Drizzle with olive oil and add the salmon steaks, skin side down.  Salt and pepper the salmon.  Cook for 5 min or so, then flip and cook the other side for another 5 min.  While this is going on, scrape of the salmon skin.

Whisk together the olive oil, white wine vinegar and dijon mustard in a small bowl, to make the salad dressing.

Cook the pasta following packet timings.  I use 1 tbsp table salt and 1.5 liter of water.

Drain the pasta, and add back to the pan.  Mix in the dressing, then stir in the tomatoes and rocket.

Serve onto plates, and add the salmon on top.
