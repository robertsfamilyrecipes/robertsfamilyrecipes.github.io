This recipe is from [Ainsley Harriott's Friends & Family Cookbook](
https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ainsley-Harriotts-Friends-Family-Cookbook-ebook/dp/B01N024L5G/).  He also has a version in his [Feel-Good Cookbook](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Feel-Good-Cookbook-Ainsley-Harriott-ebook/dp/B01NCS42MS/).

A pack of sausage normally weighs 375g, so this recipe uses 1&frac12; pack.  I normally cook double the recipe here, with 3 pack of sausage.

### Ingredients

450g
:   chipolata sausages

&nbsp;
:   olive oil

2
:   red onion, thinly sliced

1 tbsp
:   tomato puree

1
:   red pepper, chopped

1
:   yellow pepper, chopped

2
:   garlic clove, crushed

1 tsp
:   chipotle chilli flakes

&frac12; tsp
:   dried oregano

1 tin
:   tomatoes

&frac14; tsp
:   brown sugar

&nbsp;
:   salt and pepper

_Pasta_

500g
:   short pasta (penne, fusilli etc.)

1.5 litre
:   water

1 tbsp
:   table salt

### Method

Heat a large saucepan on low heat.  Add olive oil and sliced onions, and cook until translucent.  This takes about 20 minutes.

Meanwhile in a large frying pan cook the sausage.  You want to start with the pan hot, add the sausage and some oil and cook for a couple of minutes.  Then turn the heat down to medium-low, shake the sausage around and continue cooking.  You're aiming for a slow cook, about 20 minutes, where the sausage get browned and the brown gunky stuff accumulates on the bottom of the pan.  Be careful to not overdo it, your don't want the brown gunk to burn and blacken.  When the sausage are cooked, you can start adding them to the sauce.

When the onions are pretty cooked, add the tomato puree and fry for a couple of minutes.  Then add the pepper and cook for 5-10 min.  When the peppers have cooked a bit add the garlic, chilli and oregano.  Cook for a couple of minutes then add the tinned tomatoes and sugar.

By now the sausage should be cooked.  Using scissors cut them into the sauce, you should get 5 or 6 pieces per sausage.  Deglaze the sausage pan with water, and add to the sauce.  Cook the sauce for 10-20 minutes.  Taste for salt.

Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil.  I use 1 tbsp of table salt for 1.5 litre of water.  Cook the pasta following the packet timings.  Drain the pasta and serve, with the sauce dolloped on top.
