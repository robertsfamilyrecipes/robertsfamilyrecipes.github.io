### Ingredients

100g
:   butter

&frac12;
:   lemon, juice and zest

4
:   garlic cloves, crushed to paste

2 tbsp
:   tarragon, finely chopped

&nbsp;
:   salt and pepper

4
:   chicken breasts

&nbsp;
:   flour

2
:   eggs, beaten

&nbsp;
:   panko breadcrumbs

&nbsp;
:   sunflower oil

&nbsp;
:   cocktail sticks

### Method

Make the tarragon butter.  Mash the butter, then beat in lemon juice, zest, garlic, tarragon, salt and pepper.  Roll the butter into a tube, wrap in cling film, and refrigerate.

Prepare the chicken.  Gently beat the chicken breast flat with a rolling pin.  Season with salt and pepper on both sides.  Put a line of tarragon butter down the centre.  Roll up the breasts, and pin closed with cocktail sticks.  You want to try and seal the butter completely inside the chicken breast.  Dip each breast in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.  Chill for 30 minutes.

Cook the chicken.  Heat the oven to **160&deg;C** fan.  Heat an oven proof frying pan, big enough to hold all the chicken.  When hot, add oil, then chicken. Do not move the chicken around.  Cook for about 5 min, until breadcrumbs are browned.  Flip over and cook for another 5 min.			Put the frying pan in the oven, to finish for 5 min.  Remove the cocktail sticks and serve.

Don't burn your hand on the frying pan handle.
