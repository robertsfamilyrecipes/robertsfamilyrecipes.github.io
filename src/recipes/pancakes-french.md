Thin french style pancake from Sophie Pitner.

### Ingredients

* 250g flour
* 4 eggs
* 500ml milk (full fat)
* sunflower oil
* &frac12; tsp table salt

### Method

Make the batter.  Sift the flour into a bowl, add the salt, break in the eggs, add &frac13; of the milk.  Whisk until smooth.  It is much easier to get rid of lumps when the mixture is thick, so don't add the rest of the milk until the lumps are gone.

Cook the pancakes.  Heat a frying pan to medium.  Add the oil then batter.  Gently cook the pancake, then flip, then cook some more.

Wipe the pan, and add a bit of oil between each pancake.
