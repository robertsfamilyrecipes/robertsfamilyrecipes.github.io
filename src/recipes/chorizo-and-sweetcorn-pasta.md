This recipe is adapter from [The Top One Hundred Patsa Sauces by Diane Seed](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Diane-Seed-Hundred-Pasta-Sauces/dp/B005Z54WLS/).

### Ingredients

25g
:   butter

1
:   onion, finely chopped

1
:   garlic clove, finely sliced

1 tin
:   tomatoes

&frac14; tsp
:   brown sugar

400g
:   chorizo, diced

200g tin
:   sweetcorn, drained

500g
:   conchiglie, or other short pasta

### Method

Cook the onions.  Melt the butter in a pan over a medium low heat.  Add the onion and soften, about 20 min.

Cook the chorizo.  Heat a frying pan to hot, add the chorizo, and turn the heat down to medium.  Cook until the chorizo is a bit browned and has released some oil.

Make the sauce.  Add the garlic to the onions, and gently fry for a couple of minutes.  Add the tomatoes, sugar, chorizo and chorizo oil.  Turn the heat to medium and cook for about 20 min on a slow bubble.  Near the end add the drained sweetcorn and taste for salt.

Cook the pasta following packet timings.  I use 1.5 litre of water and 1 tbsp salt.

Drain the pasta and mix in the sauce.  Serve.
