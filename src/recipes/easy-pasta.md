### Method

Heat a pan to medium.  Add oil and bacon and fry until crispy.

Turn down heat to low and add onion.  Fry until translucent.

Add garlic and fry for 2 min.

Add tomatoes, sugar and chilli.  Turn heat to medium, and cook on a slow bubble for 20 min.

Taste for salt.  You may well not need any because the bacon is very salty.

Cook pasta to packet timings.  I use 1.5 litre of water and 1 tbsp of salt.
